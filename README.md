# Prediction of Breast Cancer Survival Using Machine Learning

Beast cancer is among the most common cancers worldwide. Thanks to advances in technology, medical information such as images, gene mutations and molecular activities can be obtained clinically. The abundance and mobility of data offered opportunities for healthcare workers worldwide to study a large number of patients
to gain a deeper understanding of the disease and design better treatments for patients. However, processing of such data is not possible without data analytical
tools such as machine learning. In fact, machine learning has been used in medicine for decades. The increase in quantity and quality of data has enabled machine
learning to produce more promising results in patient-specific therapy. The project reviews machine learning algorithms implemented in existing literature, three of
which will be implemented by the authors, namely random forests, L1 logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM). A novel data set on breast cancer
is used and the aim is to predict the survival of patients 10 years after they are diagnosed with breast cancer. The viability of the methods will be valued based on their accuracy and the important features they discover.

This project was completed in partnership with Kashvi Srivastava, Malavika Mukundan and Shirlyn Wang.
